# uff-parser

A UFF58 file parser intended for use with vibration data.
Extracts key fields (frequency spacing, number of measurements and amplitude data and misc. data)

Hopefully this package will:
 Have multithreading support
 Outperform existing UFF readers (pyuff for python as well as my own python code)
